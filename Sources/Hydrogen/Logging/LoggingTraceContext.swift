/// running an OpenTelemetry tracer (or any other span emitter) populate
/// this key on the active ``ServiceContext`` at span entry. When set,
/// ``StructuredLogHandler`` calls
/// ``StructuredLogProfile/traceCorrelation`` to convert the IDs into
/// vendor-specific log metadata. The
/// ``StructuredLogProfile/plain`` profile emits no correlation by
/// default; the GCP profile (in the `HydrogenGCP` target) emits the
/// `logging.googleapis.com/trace`, `.../spanId`, and `.../trace_sampled`
/// fields recognised by Cloud Logging.
///
/// The IDs follow the W3C Trace Context spec:
/// 32 lower-case hex chars for `traceID`, 16 for `spanID`. Cloud Logging
/// (and most other ingesters) require those exact shapes — anything
/// else gets emitted as plain metadata without the "view trace" link.

/// Decoupling note: this type names neither OpenTelemetry nor any other
/// tracing implementation. The bridge from the tracer's span context to
/// `LoggingTraceContext` lives in the consumer's tracing setup so
/// Hydrogen stays vendor-neutral.
