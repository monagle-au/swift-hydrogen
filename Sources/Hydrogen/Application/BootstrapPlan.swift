///
/// Lifecycle services are not registered through ``ServiceRegistry`` because
/// they're not addressed by ``ServiceKey`` — user code doesn't pull them out

/// A plan for the global one-shot bootstraps that swift-log, swift-metrics,
/// and swift-distributed-tracing each require.
///
/// Returned from ``HydrogenCommand/bootstrap(config:environment:)`` and
/// applied by ``BootstrapCoordinator`` after CLI parsing and before any
/// `Logger` is constructed. Every field is optional — an empty plan is a
/// valid no-op.
///
/// ## Ordering
///
/// When applied, the coordinator installs subsystems in this order:
///
/// 1. Tracing — `InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(instrument)`
/// 2. Metrics — `MetricsSystem.bootstrap(metricsFactory)`
/// 3. Logging — `LoggingSystem.bootstrap(logHandlerFactory, metadataProvider:)`
///
/// Logging comes last so that any `Logger.MetadataProvider` you supply can
/// reference task-local context that the tracer set on its first span.
