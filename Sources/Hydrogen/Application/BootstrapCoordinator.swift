// MARK: - BootstrapCoordinator

/// Process-wide one-shot guard for the global bootstraps.
///
/// `LoggingSystem.bootstrap`, `MetricsSystem.bootstrap`, and
/// `InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap` are each callable exactly once per
/// process. `BootstrapCoordinator` wraps that constraint behind a single
/// idempotent ``apply(_:)`` so multi-subcommand applications (where every
/// subcommand may build its own ``BootstrapPlan``) can call it without fear
/// of double-bootstrap.
///
/// ## Behaviour
///
/// - Each subsystem is bootstrapped at most once. ``apply(_:)`` is
///   idempotent per subsystem: a second plan that sets a field already
///   installed by an earlier plan silently no-ops that field. This lets
///   apps split bootstrap into multiple calls (e.g. tracing first, then
///   logging) and lets multiple subcommands each call ``apply(_:)``
///   without coordination.
/// - Each subsystem is bootstrapped only if its corresponding field is
///   set. A plan that supplies only a tracer leaves logging and metrics
///   on their swift-log / swift-metrics defaults.
/// - Empty plans are always no-ops.
///
/// ## Ordering
///
/// Subsystems install in this order so logging metadata providers can read
/// trace context populated by the tracer on the first span:
///
/// 1. `InstrumentationSystem.bootstrap(plan.instrument)`
/// 2. `MetricsSystem.bootstrap(plan.metricsFactory)`
/// 3. `LoggingSystem.bootstrap(plan.logHandlerFactory, metadataProvider:)`
///
/// ## Interaction with the static escape-hatch methods
///
/// ``HydrogenApplication/bootstrapLogging(using:metadataProvider:logLevel:)``
/// and ``HydrogenApplication/bootstrapTracing(using:)`` route through this
/// coordinator so that an app calling them in an overridden `main()` is
/// observed as "already bootstrapped" by the in-`run()` flow. Either path
/// works; the coordinator just enforces single-application semantics.
